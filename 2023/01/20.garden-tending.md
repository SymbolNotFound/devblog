# Garden Tending, "an update on my employment"

Well, not completely unexpected but nonetheless surprising.

It feels sudden, but I'm feeling optimistic and hopeful about it.  Not quite sure what's next.

I will be on gardening leave until the end of April.  I didn't even know what
that term meant until today.  I just launched a project last month and, despite
it being an open source project, I'm being told not to touch it.

I'm not entirely surprised Google decided to reduce its workforce, and I am
confident it was not a performance-based decision (by definition it is not
supposed to be, but knowing who else was laid off is also an indicator).
I can take some time, perhaps a sabbatical was overdue.

In a way, it's liberating -- there were projects I wasn't allowed to work on
(for company policy reasons), that I can think about and work on now.  Well, in
a few months.  I can think about them now.
