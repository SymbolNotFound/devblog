# SymbolNotFound developer blog

Aspirationally, I would love this to be a collection of advice, tutorials and
updates related to the General Game Playing service project I am working on,
including topics related to building, maintaining and promoting a SaaS product.

Realistically, it takes me 2-3x as long to write and edit a high-quality post
of any real substance than it does to write the code at the core of discussion.

And, anyone who knows me knows that I'm not a huge fan of social networks, so
I lack an intrinsic motivation to spend time and thought-energy on posting the
latest about what I'm working on.  That has more to do with the consequences of
spending significant time in the tarpit that is most social networking sites and
less to do with the social interaction (though I do lean introverted, too).

However, I understand that success will be limited if I hole myself up and only
spend time building and researching.  So, I periodically remind myself that it
would be great if I share something in the form of writing.  Something that at
a high level provides a hint at what I'm up to, for those who may be interested.

The part that I do enjoy is the teaching & learning aspect.  So, a lot of posts
here are tutorial-focused or an attempt at providing insight.  I get more from
thinking about how it might help someone else than I do from the completing
of a thing.

I am still figuring out a good schedule or cadence but I will be committing to
at least twice a week updates.  I will be favoring essay-length topics that can
be read in less than 10 minutes, and something like CODE (Capture, Organize,
Distill, Express) to convert my notebooks of chaos into something fitting for
this site.

I might add an email list if there's interest, but first I want to see myself
reach a goal of posting something new frequently enough (Key Result = at
least 15 posts by the end of September 2024).
