# Game Mechanic: Race

Many of the earliest known games such as Nyout, Patolli, Royal Game of Goose,
Senat, Cribbage and Backgammon have this common mechanic: advancing tokens to
reach a goal before the opponent(s).  Usually aided with dice for an element
of chance, players compete for scoring higher rolls and avoiding blockades or
captures from the other players or the environment.

This game mechanic also describes gameplay where skill advances the
player's position (as in an actual leg race) but does not include the
objective of reaching a certain point total; the objective is positional.

## Related game mechanics

This mechanic combines well with environment-hazard and peer-punishment.  There
are exceptions (cribbage has no environment sensitive effects, Nyout and Senat
are without the ability of resetting an opponent's progress).  Sometimes the
rules require that the final throw exactly match the final position in the race
(no-overthrows).

It is almost always paired with the move-pointwise mechanic and action-roll-spin
for the play area and player action, for there to be movement to race against.

This does not include games
where the end state is dependent on either player being unable to move -- the
mechanic implies that a player is able to win the game by achieving a certain
state, not by the inability of their opponent to make a move, although a game
can have both types of mechanics together.

## Board dependency

This mechanic usually depends on a board-linear-path or board-spiral-path even
when the layout is in a grid (e.g., with Snakes & Ladders).  Because the race
mechanic involves edging out the opponents, the terrain involved is usually
narrow or full of bottlenecks.  The cross inside of a circle from Nyout is an
example of how a simple layout can still offer multiple points of contention,
when the board is not a simple path.  Chinese Checkers is an example of combining race and a grid, in this case a hexagonal grid, but it is rare.

## See Also

This is not to be confused with another sense of race, that of a distinction
of origin or background.  Some games do employ different commanders' or units'
lineage for gameplay but this is represented by the variable-player-powers
mechanic in games where the difference has any consequence.  Otherwise that
meaning of race has no bearing on gameplay or other game mechanics.
