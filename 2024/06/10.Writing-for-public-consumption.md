I enjoy writing, but mostly for myself.  I take notes, scribble design sketches,
plot strategies on dry-erase boards, type and thumb my opinions... but except
for semi-frequent comments in public fora like Hacker News I hardly write any
content intended for public consumption.

Well, I think it's time to change that.  Time to share more with the world.

I'll write more about how I set up vitepress in the next post.  I've been
playing with it this past week and it's what I've been looking for in 
blog publishing platform -- very extensible, slightly opinionated,
capable.  And it accepts markdown as a content format.

<script setup>
import JankenGame from '../components/JankenGame.vue'
</script>

What else is cool?.. embedding Vue3 components right in the middle of a post!

<JankenGame />

...and then continue on writing the rest of the post in markdown.

This will make it easier to demo partial versions and reuse components 
from the principle body of work.
