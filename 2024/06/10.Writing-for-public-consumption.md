I enjoy writing, but mostly for myself.  I take notes, scribble design sketches,
plot strategies on dry-erase boards, type and thumb my opinions... but except
for semi-frequent comments in public fora like Hacker News I hardly write any
content intended for public consumption.

Well, I think it's time to change that.

TODO write rest of the document, but submit a working "excerpt extractor" first.

Vitepress makes getting a sorted list of recent documents and their metadata
a surprisingly easy task, considering.  And only generated at build time, wonderful.

I guess I'll probably write mostly about how I set up vitepress in the next post.
