title: JSON Boolish, a (golang) sum type of convenience
---

# Boolish, for a boolean-encoding arbitrary-decoding golang type

I was scraping and extracting some data stored in JSON that has thid annoying
quality of sometimes using an integer value (0, or 1, or !0) for booleans.  And
since I was doing the scraping in Go (farming xp, mostly) I had to type them.
But, even more annoyingly, this JSON also sometimes used boolean literals for
its booleans, so the typing in Go had to accommodate both.

Here's what I did:

---

```go
// Boolean data type with custom (accommodating) JSON decoder.
//
// Wraps a boolean value rather than providing an interface that can convert to either.
// See {json.Number} for an example of providing multiple compatible types,
// but if it is meant to be a boolean it should solely be represented as a boolean, IMO.
//
// Always encodes as boolean when serializing back to JSON.
type Boolish struct {
	Value bool
}

func (b *Boolish) UnmarshalJSON(encoded []byte) error {
	var boolVal bool
	if err := json.Unmarshal(encoded, &boolVal); err != nil {
		b.Value = boolVal
	} else {
		var intVal int
		if err := json.Unmarshal(encoded, &boolVal); err != nil {
			b.Value = (intVal != 0)
		} else {
			return err
		}
	}
	return nil
}

func (b Boolish) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
	return json.Marshal(b.Value)
}
```

Then, in any code that had to get a bool that might be encoded either way,
or may not even be present for a particular data instance, it is easy to use:

```go
type MatchDetails struct {
  // ...other fields, and...
	LeagueMatch Boolish `json:"isLeagueMatch"`
	Online      Boolish `json:"isOnline"`
  
  // ...
}
```

It does mean having to access a `.Value` property to get an actual boolean.  You
could add .True() or .Equals[T bool|Boolish](other T).  You could add a string
decoder, too, for falsey values there, but the details of what is considered
true may vary from instance to instance (is "false" true or false?  In contexts
where any non-empty string is true, !!0).  And really, I hope you only narrowly
use this for inane external data sources and scrub it right out before saving
the data elsewhere (hence, the behavior of the MarshalJSON function above).
